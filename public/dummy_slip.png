(binary content mocked by empty file for now, actually I can't write binary easily. I'll stick to a text file renamed to .png or just skip actual upload if the browser agent fails to handle it. Actually, I can use a real image if I knew where one is. I will use the one found in Metadata: /Users/phiopan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e714628b-27b0-4f50-b680-e0660f739848/uploaded_image_1766682023726.png)
